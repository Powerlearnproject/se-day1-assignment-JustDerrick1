#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

  Software engineering is a branch of computer science thats used for developing, testing and maintaining software.
  scalability and flexibility- Software engineering principles allow for the development of systems that can grow and evolve with changing demands, accommodating    increased user bases and new features. 
  Security-  Software engineers incorporate security measures to protect user data and systems from cyber threats, a critical aspect in today's digital landscape. 
  Efficiency - It helps optimize developer workflow while miantaining high quality standards.
  Reliability - Ensures softwares perform as expected without bias

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

 1. The birth of software egineering (1968)- This milestone marked the beginning of software development as an engineering discipline, emphasizing structured           approaches, formal methods, and best practices to improve software quality and reliability.
 2. The rise of structured programming (1970s)- This period saw the emergence of formalized programming languages like C, which provided better structure and           abstraction.
 3. The agile revolution(2001) - This shift led to the widespread adoption of DevOps, continuous deployment, and modern software development practices that             emphasize rapid delivery and adaptation to changing requirements.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Planning - Identify the software requirement
2. Requirement analysis -  Identify the final user specification.
3. Design - building the framework.
4. Coding - converting software design into tangible code.
5. Testing - Examine the software for any bugs and glitches.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

1. Waterfall methodology - follows a linear sequence of events. In Waterfall, each phase of the project is gated. Teams cannot advance from one phase of the SDLC     to the next until the current phase is complete. It suits projects that require a high volume of documentation and have repeatable, predictable processes. It      is especially effective for projects with well-defined requirements and minimal expected changes, ensuring consistency and traceable control.
2. Agile methodology - Is an approach that prioritizes collaboration, continuous delivery and customer feedback. It breaks work into iterative steps, which are       smaller tasks that can be completed quickly.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

1. Softwaere Developer - Responsible for developing programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer - Collaborates with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
3. Project Manager - Responsible for assembling and leading the software development team.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

1. Intergrated Development Environments (IDEs) - is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to           write, compile, and debug code.
   Importance:
   An IDE can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using different font colors. These visual cues make the source code    more readable and give instant feedback about accidental syntax errors.
   IDEs increase programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code change. The following are some examples     of regular coding tasks that an IDE carries out.

2. Version Control Systems - are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. eg Git
    Importance:
   Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts.
   Change Tracking: Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification. 
   Branching and Merging: Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.
   Error Recovery: Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1. Time Constraints - Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under high pressure to meet tight deadlines.
   Solution: Adopting agile methodology to streamline projects.

2. Limited Infrastructure - limited high-performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures.
   Solution: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.

3. Changing Software Requirements - Software requirements are often dynamic and subject to frequent changes.
   Solution: engineers can adopt approaches like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and modular design, which enables           flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independent components.

4. Software Security - Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task.
   Solution: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats

5. Software Accessibility and Usability - Overly complex software can frustrate or confuse users.
   Solution: Use scalable architecture, Emphasize reliability.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1. Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by    your software. - it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
2.  Integration tests - help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
3.  System testing - It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .
4.  Acceptance Tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

 Prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
 
 Importancce: 
1. Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
2. Developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish         context to the large language models. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.
3. Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be           present from existing human bias in the large language models’ training data.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt: Describe a historical event.

"Write a 500-word summary of the causes and impact of the Kenyan Independence, focusing on its effects on political systems and global independence movements."

1. Clarity – Clearly defines the historical event (Kenyan Independence).
2. Specificity – Narrows the focus to causes, impact, and political effects.
3. Conciseness – Sets a word limit (500 words) to guide the response.
